# cauldron-wc24
this name is because of containers

and a cauldron contains stuff


# What's it do?
(Eventually) this project will be able to take a writer and encrypt/decrypt its content as needed. Also just putting it in/out of the container format.

# How can I help out?
Currently this only decrypts out of the container format. Encryption and containment/extraction needs to be done.
